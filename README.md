# RESTful API Gateway for a Social Network Platform - Concept App

## Summary

I built this App because I wanted to learn more about using a NoSQL Database in
collaboration with an Express server running on Node. I used MongoDB as my
Database, and Mongoose as my ODM.

## The Concept

A social network platform with a fully-functional RESTful API gateway. The API
connects to a NoSQL Database that is fast, flexible, and allows for large volumes
of unstructured data.

- All activity within the platform is tied to a unique `User`.
- A `User` has full crud-functionality.
- A `User` post or delete friends, which must be another `User` in the platform.
- A `User` can post or delete `Thoughts`, which are posts.
- A `User` can post or delete a `Reactions` to `Users` `Thoughts`, are resposnes to a thought.

## Node Package Dependencies

<!-- - **Utility**
  - [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - Used for local enviornment variables. -->
  <!-- - [moment]([#moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)) - Used by full-stack front helper functions for date-time manipulation. -->
<!-- - **Security**
  - [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) - Used to allow a secure client sessions via the web browsers cookies/local caching.
  - [connect-session-sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-session-sequelize) - Used to create a session between user and the Database.
  - [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) - Used to hash user passwords. -->
- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - The controller managing all communication between view and the database.
<!-- - **View**
  - [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars) - The View engine running the users for full-stack app. -->
- [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) - A DRM for the MongoDB API database.
  <!-- - [mysql2](#mysql2) - A DRM for MySQL/JawsDB full-stack frontend User database.
  - [sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) - ORM for MySQL/JawsDB full-stack frontend user database. -->

## Getting Setup

<!-- The APP can either be ran Headless as an API Gateway or as a complete Full-Stack. -->

<!-- ### Headless | MongoDB & Express -->

<!-- > It's meant to server as an API-Gateway to an already existing View. -->

<!-- #### Requirements - Getting Set Up for Headless -->
**Steps**

1. [MongoDB](mongodb.com/try/download/community) is fully insatlled and setup
  > [See guide here for help](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb)
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/download) is fully instealled and setup
  > [See guide here for help](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs)
3. [Download the Repo](https://github.com/ErikPlachta/api-gateway-express-mongodb/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
4. Unzip and Open with your IDE of choice
5. Install Node Packages with `npm i`
6. Run with `npm start`
7. Start making API calls
    > *This APP is designed to be a headless RESTful API gateway. You'll need to use a tool like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) to use it.*

<!-- ### B. Full-Stack | MongoDB, MySQL, Express, Handlebars
  
The headless version of the APP is a complete MVC stack. It includes a Model,
Controller, and View for a complete user experience.

#### Requirements - Getting Setup for Full-Stack

- [MongoDB](mongodb.com/try/download/community) is fully insatlled and setup
  > [See guide here for help](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/download) is fully instealled and setup
  > [See guide here for help](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) is fully insatlled and setup
  > [See guide here for help](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide)
- [Download the Repo](https://github.com/ErikPlachta/api-gateway-express-mongodb/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- Unzip and Open with your IDE of choice
- Install Node Packages with `npm i`
- Update your .env file
  - `RENAME.env` to `.env`
  - Add your MySQL login details
    - Add `DB_USER`
    - Add `DB_PASSWORD`
  - Crate your own `SECRET` -->
